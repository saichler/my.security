# my.security
My Security, security for my simple

The my security is kept as a different project than my.simple for it to be implemented as a plugin in the future, thus not being change or impact by the my.simple train.

It contains **ONLY** the SecurityProvider base interface so a security provider implemented and compiled as a plugin would not be invalidated whenever there is a change in the my.simple project.
